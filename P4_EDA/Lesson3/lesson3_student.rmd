```
Lesson 3
========================================================

***

### What to Do First?
Notes:

***

### Pseudo-Facebook User Data
Notes:

```{r Pseudo-Facebook User Data}
getwd()
setwd("/Users/lotusfire/workspace/data-analyst/P4_EDA/Lesson3")
list.files()
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv',sep='\t')
names(pf)
```

### Histogram of Users' Birthdays
Notes:


```{r Histogram of Users\' Birthdays}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)

# install.packages('ggthemes', dependencies = TRUE) 
# library(ggthemes) 

qplot(x = dob_day, data = pf) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:31) +
  facet_wrap(~dob_month, ncol = 3)
```

### Estimating Your Audience Size
Notes:

***

#### Think about a time when you posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What was it?
Response:

#### How many of your friends do you think saw that post?
Response:

#### Think about what percent of your friends on Facebook see any posts or comments that you make in a month. What percent do you think that is?
Response:

### Faceting
Notes:

```{r Faceting}

```

#### Let’s take another look at our plot. What stands out to you here?
Response:

***

### Be Skeptical - Outliers and Anomalies
Notes:

***

### Moira's Outlier
Notes:
#### Which case do you think applies to Moira’s outlier?
Response:

***

### Friend Count
Notes:

#### What code would you enter to create a histogram of friend counts?

```{r Friend Count}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)
```

#### How is this plot similar to Moira's first plot?
Response:

***

### Limiting the Axes
Notes:

```{r Limiting the Axes}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, xlim = c(0,1000))
```

### Exploring with Bin Width
Notes:

***

### Adjusting the Bin Width
Notes:

### Faceting Friend Count
```{r Faceting Friend Count}
# What code would you add to create a facet the histogram by gender?
# Add it to the code below.
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```

***

### Omitting NA Values
Notes:

```{r Omitting NA Values}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
  
qplot(x = friend_count, data = na.omit(pf), binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```

***

### Statistics 'by' Gender
Notes:

```{r Statistics \'by\' Gender}

table(pf$gender)
by(pf$friend_count, pf$gender, summary)
```

#### Who on average has more friends: men or women?
Response:

#### What's the difference between the median friend count for women and men?
Response:

#### Why would the median be a better measure than the mean?
Response:

***

### Tenure
Notes:

```{r Tenure}
qplot(x = tenure/365, data = pf, binwidth = .25, 
  xlab = 'Nomber of years using Facebook' ,
  ylab = 'Number od users in sample',
  color = I('black'), fill = I('#F79420')
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7) 

```

***

#### How would you create a histogram of tenure by year?

```{r Tenure Histogram by Year}

```

***

### Labeling Plots
Notes:

```{r Labeling Plots}

```

***

### User Ages
Notes:

```{r User Ages}
qplot(x = age, data = pf, binwidth = 1, 
  xlab = 'User ages',
  ylab = 'Number of users in sample',
  color = I('black'), fill = I('#5760AB')) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 113),
                     breaks = seq(0, 113, 5))
```

### Transforming Data
Notes:

***

```{r}
install.packages('gridExtra') 
library(gridExtra) 

qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)

p1 <- qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)

p2 <- qplot(x = log10(friend_count + 1 ), data = pf)

p3 <- qplot(x = sqrt(friend_count), data = pf) 

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=1)
```

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(aes( x =friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_histogram()
  
p2 <- p1 + scale_x_log10()
